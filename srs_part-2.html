        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for the development of an exam web app that allows
            users to create cohorts, conduct assessments, and manage exam-related activities. This is a whole new system 
            that is being created for taking exams with proper security. This is a new system that is not any patch for any other 
            system. We will also create a mobile app for the convenience for the audience.</p>

        <p>[Describe any conventions followed in this document.]</p>

        <h3>1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
        <p>This document is intended for developers, project managers, faculty members, students, testers, and documentation
            writers. It is organized to provide an overview of the app's functionality, features, and user interactions.</p>

        <h3>1.4 Product Scope</h3>
        <p>This Exam Taking Web Application is a user-centric platform designed for taking the exams and assessment of the exams smoothly.
           It allows students to take exams online, providing instant feedback and enabling remote participation. 
           Teachers benefit from easy to create question papers functionality, automated grading, live feedback of the students while taking 
           exams, and revise the grades later if needed. The application aligns with educational institutions' goals of efficiency, accessibility,
           and academic excellence, offering a secure and 
           innovative solution for modernizing the exam experience.</p>

            <h4>Hardware Platform:</h4>
            <p> Desktop and laptop computers need to have at least 4GB of RAM and a modern processor. And mobile devices(Android) need to have enough 
            sufficient memory and a decent processor to run the mobile application.</p>
            
            <h4>Web Browsers:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Chrome(latest version)</li>
                <li>Mozilla Firefox (latest version)</li>
                <li>Microsoft Edge (latest version)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Software Dependencies:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Server: The application requires a web server, such as Apache or Nginx, to serve web pages and manage user requests.</li>
                <li>Backend Framework: The application is built using a specific backend framework (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails),
                     which handles data processing, authentication, and interactions with the database.</li>
                <li>Database Management System: The application uses a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase) to store user data, 
                    assessment details, and results.</li>
                <li>Image Processing Libraries: To verify student identity, the application interfaces with image processing 
                    libraries such as OpenCV.</li>
                <li>External Libraries: There maybe many external libraries to make the functionality of the app smooth.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>External Services</h4>
            <p>Email Services: The application integrates with third-party email services (e.g., SendGrid, SMTP servers) to send invitation links and notifications to users.</p>


        <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Implementation adheres to privacy and data protection regulations.</li>
